		3. The third element represents a parameter 't' which is proportional to the distance between the origin of ray and the point of intersection
		4. This parameter 't' will be helpful in determining which object does the ray hits first:-the one which has the least 't' parameter
	*/

		Algo:
		1. It iterates through each of the six planes of the given object
		2. Knowing the equation of each of the planes, point of intersection of the ray with each plane can be known
		3. Thus, the 't' parameter(that is proportional to distance b/w POI and ray origin) of each plane can be calculated(and is stored in 'temp_t_of_plane_id_i' variable)
		4. Next we have to know which of the six planes has the least and positive(+ve because the POI has to be along the direction of the ray and not in the backward direction) 't' parameter
		5. The POI of this plane along with its 't' parameter and the id of the plane is thus returned.

		What is 't' parameter afterall?:
		1. Consider a ray originating from a 3D point (x,y,z) and travelling along a straight line whose direction is given by its direction ratios say (p,q,r)
		2. Consider a 3D plane in the space. We have to find the point ON this plane through which the above ray passes i.e. their intersection point
		3. We use the fact that any point lying on the given ray can be represented as (x,y,z) + t*(p,q,r) = (x+t*p, y+t*q, z+t*r) where t is any floating point number
		4. Let the intersection point thus be (x+t*p, y+t*q, z+t*r)
		5. Note that greater the magnitude of t, farther it is from the point of origin (x,y,z)
		5. Since this lies on the plane with its plane equation say ax+by+cz+d=0; we can substitute the above point in this and thus find the value of t
		6. We have thus found the intersection point along with a parameter 't' ! We will use this 't' to find the nearest intersection point.
